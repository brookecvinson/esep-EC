### Introduction:  
This code creates a memory system in C++. It has the option for memory to be added to a transitional dataset before being officially commited to memory. The database uses the built-in C++ data structure maps to store the keys and values.  

### Usage:
The example main.cpp file can be run using the provided make file. It uses the commands:  
g++ main.cpp InMemoryDB.cpp -o main.o  
./main.o

###  Future Modifications
To expand on this assignment, I think instructions on how the main function should be implimented is neccessary. The main could be a user interface for interacting with the database. I ran into the issue where integers in C++ can not be returned as null but the return type of the get function is an int. I think this assignment might be a better way to teach about writing a README as well. Writing one about your own code could be more educational since students can just focus on format without having to decipher someone else's code.
